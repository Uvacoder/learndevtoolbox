# Knowledge

## Why? 🤔

Why do we want to study and understand knowledge?

Because we can only observe the world from our perspective, our shoes. Knowledge is what allowed our ancestors to survive and eat the things that would not kill us.

Nowadays in order to survive we need a job and thus (as software engineers) **knowledge of our craft** is what will allow us to cover our physiological needs and **survive**.

## For what? 😲

To obtain **effective** and **efficient solutions** from **complex systems** in any **productive sector**.

In order to exploit all resources in the universe we need to study, investigate, analyze, synthesize and know them.
