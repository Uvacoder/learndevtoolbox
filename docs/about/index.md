# About 👋🏼

#### Hello there!

My name is **Jordi** and I am a **full stack developer** from Barcelona, Spain 🇪🇸. I have decided to improve and reach the **software architect** level of expertise. In my journey towards that goal I have created this site in order to have a place where I can write my notes while attending a masters degree in an online school called [Escuela.it](https://escuela.it/).

Thats why I want to give special credit to [Escuela.it](https://escuela.it/) and the main teacher of the masters degree [Luis Fernández Muñoz](https://es.linkedin.com/in/luisfernandezmunyoz). ❤️
