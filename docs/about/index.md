# About

Hello there! my name is **Jordi** and I am a **software engineer** from Barcelona, Spain. I'm a passionate developer who has decided to improve and reach the **software architect** level of expertise. In my journey towards that goal I have created this site in order to have a place where I can write my notes while attending a masters degree in an online school called [Escuela.it](https:www.escuela.it).

Thats why I want to give special credit to [Escuela.it](https:www.escuela.it) and the main teacher of the masters degree [Luis Fernández Muñoz](https://es.linkedin.com/in/luisfernandezmunyoz).
