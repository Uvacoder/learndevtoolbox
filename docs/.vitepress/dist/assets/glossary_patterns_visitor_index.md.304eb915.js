Each node of the graph may represent a complex entity such as a city, but also more granular things like industries, sightseeing areas, etc. The nodes are connected with others if there\u2019s a road between the real objects that they represent. Under the hood, each node type is represented by its own class, while each specific node is an object.</p><p>Exporting the graph into XML Exporting the graph into XML.</p><p>At some point, you got a task to implement exporting the graph into XML format. At first, the job seemed pretty straightforward. You planned to add an export method to each node class and then leverage recursion to go over each node of the graph, executing the export method. The solution was simple and elegant: thanks to polymorphism, you weren\u2019t coupling the code which called the export method to concrete classes of nodes.</p><p>Unfortunately, the system architect refused to allow you to alter existing node classes. He said that the code was already in production and he didn\u2019t want to risk breaking it because of a potential bug in your changes.</p><p>The XML export method had to be added into all node classes The XML export method had to be added into all node classes, which bore the risk of breaking the whole application if any bugs slipped through along with the change.</p><p>Besides, he questioned whether it makes sense to have the XML export code within the node classes. The primary job of these classes was to work with geodata. The XML export behavior would look alien there.</p><p>There was another reason for the refusal. It was highly likely that after this feature was implemented, someone from the marketing department would ask you to provide the ability to export into a different format, or request some other weird stuff. This would force you to change those precious and fragile classes again.</p><h2 id="solution-\u{1F60B}" tabindex="-1">Solution \u{1F60B} <a class="header-anchor" href="#solution-\u{1F60B}" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2><p>The Visitor pattern suggests that you place the new behavior into a separate class called visitor, instead of trying to integrate it into existing classes. The original object that had to perform the behavior is now passed to one of the visitor\u2019s methods as an argument, providing the method access to all necessary data contained within the object.</p><p>Now, what if that behavior can be executed over objects of different classes? For example, in our case with XML export, the actual implementation will probably be a little bit different across various node classes. Thus, the visitor class may define not one, but a set of methods, each of which could take arguments of different types, like this:</p><p>class ExportVisitor implements Visitor is method doForCity(City c) { ... } method doForIndustry(Industry f) { ... } method doForSightSeeing(SightSeeing ss) { ... } // ... But how exactly would we call these methods, especially when dealing with the whole graph? These methods have different signatures, so we can\u2019t use polymorphism. To pick a proper visitor method that\u2019s able to process a given object, we\u2019d need to check its class. Doesn\u2019t this sound like a nightmare?</p><p>foreach (Node node in graph) if (node instanceof City) exportVisitor.doForCity((City) node) if (node instanceof Industry) exportVisitor.doForIndustry((Industry) node) // ... } You might ask, why don\u2019t we use method overloading? That\u2019s when you give all methods the same name, even if they support different sets of parameters. Unfortunately, even assuming that our programming language supports it at all (as Java and C# do), it won\u2019t help us. Since the exact class of a node object is unknown in advance, the overloading mechanism won\u2019t be able to determine the correct method to execute. It\u2019ll default to the method that takes an object of the base Node class.</p><p>However, the Visitor pattern addresses this problem. It uses a technique called Double Dispatch, which helps to execute the proper method on an object without cumbersome conditionals. Instead of letting the client select a proper version of the method to call, how about we delegate this choice to objects we\u2019re passing to the visitor as an argument? Since the objects know their own classes, they\u2019ll be able to pick a proper method on the visitor less awkwardly. They \u201Caccept\u201D a visitor and tell it what visiting method should be executed.</p><p>// Client code foreach (Node node in graph) node.accept(exportVisitor)</p><p>// City class City is method accept(Visitor v) is v.doForCity(this) // ...</p><p>// Industry class Industry is method accept(Visitor v) is v.doForIndustry(this) // ... I confess. We had to change the node classes after all. But at least the change is trivial and it lets us add further behaviors without altering the code once again.</p><p>Now, if we extract a common interface for all visitors, all existing nodes can work with any visitor you introduce into the app. If you find yourself introducing a new behavior related to nodes, all you have to do is implement a new visitor class.</p><h2 id="real-world-analogy-\u{1F30D}" tabindex="-1">Real-World Analogy \u{1F30D} <a class="header-anchor" href="#real-world-analogy-\u{1F30D}" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2><p>Insurance agent A good insurance agent is always ready to offer different policies to various types of organizations.</p><p>Imagine a seasoned insurance agent who\u2019s eager to get new customers. He can visit every building in a neighborhood, trying to sell insurance to everyone he meets. Depending on the type of organization that occupies the building, he can offer specialized insurance policies:</p><p>If it\u2019s a residential building, he sells medical insurance. If it\u2019s a bank, he sells theft insurance. If it\u2019s a coffee shop, he sells fire and flood insurance.</p><h2 id="structure" tabindex="-1">Structure <a class="header-anchor" href="#structure" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2><p>Structure of the Visitor design pattern The Visitor interface declares a set of visiting methods that can take concrete elements of an object structure as arguments. These methods may have the same names if the program is written in a language that supports overloading, but the type of their parameters must be different.</p><p>Each Concrete Visitor implements several versions of the same behaviors, tailored for different concrete element classes.</p><p>The Element interface declares a method for \u201Caccepting\u201D visitors. This method should have one parameter declared with the type of the visitor interface.</p><p>Each Concrete Element must implement the acceptance method. The purpose of this method is to redirect the call to the proper visitor\u2019s method corresponding to the current element class. Be aware that even if a base element class implements this method, all subclasses must still override this method in their own classes and call the appropriate method on the visitor object.</p><p>The Client usually represents a collection or some other complex object (for example, a Composite tree). Usually, clients aren\u2019t aware of all the concrete element classes because they work with objects from that collection via some abstract interface.</p><h2 id="pseudocode" tabindex="-1">Pseudocode <a class="header-anchor" href="#pseudocode" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2><p>In this example, the Visitor pattern adds XML export support to the class hierarchy of geometric shapes.</p><p>Structure of the Visitor pattern example Exporting various types of objects into XML format via a visitor object.</p><p>// The element interface declares an <code>accept</code> method that takes // the base visitor interface as an argument. interface Shape is method move(x, y) method draw() method accept(v: Visitor)</p><p>// Each concrete element class must implement the <code>accept</code> // method in such a way that it calls the visitor&#39;s method that // corresponds to the element&#39;s class. class Dot implements Shape is // ...</p><pre><code>// Note that we&#39;re calling \`visitDot\`, which matches the
