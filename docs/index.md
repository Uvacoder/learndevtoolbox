# Welcome! ü•≥

Welcome to the Developer Cheat Sheet! In this site you fill find a bunch of different **concepts**, **ideas**, **definitions** and **examples** related with **software development**.

The structure of the site is as follows, in the left side you fill find a menu with the **major** topics:

- [Recurrence](./recurrence/)
- [Object Oriented Programing (OOP)](./oop/)
- [Object Oriented Design](./ood/)
- [Patterns](./patterns/)
- [Software Architecture](./software-architecture/)
- [Unified Process](./unified-process/)
- [Agile](./agile/)

In each of those topics you will find a brief introduction followed different **sections** of such topic. In each section I will expand on the subject although some of them will be more practical with **code** and **examples** while others will be similar to **quick notes** and **definitions** stack together.

Hopefully this site is as helpful for you as it has been for me in one way or the other. ‚ù§Ô∏è
